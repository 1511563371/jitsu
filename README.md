* Capture events your application generates and stream to Data Warehouse;
* Pull data from APIs and save it to Data Warehouse

</a>

</p>


The fastest way to get started is deploying Jitsu with [Docker](https://jitsu.com/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker). Also we support:
- [Heroku Deployment](https://jitsu.com/docs/deployment/deploy-on-heroku)
- [Building from sources](https://jitsu.com/docs/deployment/build-from-sources)
- Read about all deployment methods on [Jitsu Documentation](https://jitsu.com/docs/deployment/)

Also, we maintain a [Jitsu.Cloud](https://cloud.jitsu.com) â€” a hosted version of Jitsu. Jitsu.Cloud [is free](https://jitsu.com/pricing) for up to 250,000 events per month. Each
project comes with demo PostgresSQL Database (up 10,000 records).

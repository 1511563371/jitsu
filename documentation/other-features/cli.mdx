# CLI

<Hint>
  Available in beta
</Hint>

**Jitsu CLI** reads files with events JSONs from local file system and send them to Jitsu via [Bulk API](/docs/sending-data/bulk-api)
where 1 file = 1 HTTP request with synchronous response. Common use case is uploading archive events into new destination.
All big files larger than [max chunk size](#maxchunksize) are divided into parts according to [max chunk size](#maxchunksize) configuration and parts are sent separately: 1 part - 1 HTTP request.

### Build

Jitsu CLI is in `server` submodule, for building it please make sure that you have installed and added [go compiler](https://golang.org/doc/install) to PATH env.
Then make sure that you have checkout Jitsu project:

```
git clone https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu.git
git checkout beta
cd jitsu/server
```

Then build `server` binary with the following command:

```
go build
```

`server` binary which contains CLI will be created in your current dir.

### Run

Run command structure:
```
./server <command> [flags] <list of files to upload>
```

<Hint>
  Currently only <code inline="true">replay</code> command is supported
</Hint>

List of files can be a bash expression with wildcard. All directories in the list will be read recursively.

Examples:

```
./server replay --api_key s2s.jduavdas.daosbdab file1 file2 file3
```

```
./server replay --api_key s2s.jduavdas.daosbdab file*
```

<Hint>
  Ubuntu: If you use files pattern <code inline="true">/dir/*</code> and have an error <code inline="true">argument list too long</code>
  please increase the limit with <code inline="true">ulimit -s 65535</code> command.
</Hint>

### State

Jitsu CLI supports state file to prevent sending one file on each run. Names of already uploaded files are stored into state file
and CLI won't send them more. CLI run with `--state` flag:

```
./server replay --api_key s2s.jduavdas.daosbdab --state cli_state.state file*
```

### Filtering files by date

Jitsu CLI supports filtering files by date. CLI will read file names and filter files that contains date in name
and this date isn't in start-end interval. `--start` and `--end` flags can be used together or separately and should be
in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. `--start` flag will be treated as the beginning of the day UTC `YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00.000Z` and
`--end` flag will be treated as the end of the day UTC `YYYY-MM-DD 23:59:59.999Z`:

```
./server replay --api_key s2s.jduavdas.daosbdab --state cli_state.state --start 2021-01-01 --end 2021-01-08 file*
```

<Hint>
  If date filters flags are provided and a file doesn't have any date in name it won't be sent to Jitsu.
</Hint>

### Max chunk size

Max chunk size parameter controls request payload size. If a file is smaller than max chunk size Jitsu CLI will send
it as one HTTP request. If a file is larger - CLI will divide the file into parts where 1 part size is smaller or equal
max chunk size and send them to Jitsu.
You can override max chunk size configuration with `--chunk_size` flag and value in bytes:

- chunk size 100KB = 100 * 1024: `--chunk_size 102400`
- chunk size 10MB = 10 * 1024 * 1024: `--chunk_size 10485760`

```
./server replay --api_key s2s.jduavdas.daosbdab --state cli_state.state --chunk_size 10485760 /mydir/*
```

<Hint>
  Make sure that your user have enough permissions for writing state file
</Hint>

### Flags

You can use `./server replay -h` command for showing all flags and usage

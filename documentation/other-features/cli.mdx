# CLI


**Jitsu CLI** reads files with events JSONs from local file system and send them to Jitsu via [Bulk API](/docs/sending-data/bulk-api)
where 1 file = 1 HTTP request with synchronous response. Common use case is uploading archive events into new destination.
Use a certain `--api_key` for routing events payload into a certain destination.
All big files larger than [max chunk size](#max-chunk-size) are divided into parts with size smaller or equal to [max chunk size](#max-chunk-size) configuration and parts are sent separately: 1 part = 1 HTTP request.

### Build

Jitsu CLI is located in `server` submodule, for building it please make sure that you have installed and added [go compiler](https://golang.org/doc/install) to PATH env.
Checkout [Jitsu project](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu.git
cd jitsu/server
```

Build `server` binary with the following command:

```bash
go build
```

`server` binary will be created in your current dir. It contains CLI.

### Run

Command structure:
```bash
./server <command> [flags] <list of files to upload>
```

<Hint>
  Currently only <code inline="true">replay</code> command is supported
</Hint>

List of files can be a bash expression with wildcard. All directories in the list will be read recursively.

Examples:

```bash
./server replay --api_key s2s.jduavdas.daosbdab file1 file2 file3
```

or just
```bash
./server replay --api_key s2s.jduavdas.daosbdab file*
```

<Hint>
  Ubuntu: If you use files pattern <code inline="true">/dir/*</code> and receive <code inline="true">argument list too long</code> error
  please increase the limit with <code inline="true">ulimit -s 65535</code> command.
</Hint>

### State

Jitsu CLI supports state file to prevent resending the same file on each run. Names of already uploaded files are stored into state file
and CLI won't resend them. Use `--state` flag:

```bash
./server replay --api_key s2s.jduavdas.daosbdab --state cli_state.state file*
```

### Filtering files by date

Jitsu CLI supports filtering files by date. CLI will read file names and filter files that contains date in name
and this date isn't in start-end interval. `--start` and `--end` flags can be used together or separately and should be
in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. `--start` flag will be treated as the beginning of the day UTC `YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00.000Z` and
`--end` flag will be treated as the end of the day UTC `YYYY-MM-DD 23:59:59.999Z`:

```bash
./server replay --api_key s2s.jduavdas.daosbdab --state cli_state.state --start 2021-01-01 --end 2021-01-08 file*
```

<Hint>
  If date filter flags are provided and a file doesn't have any date in name it won't be sent to Jitsu.
</Hint>

### Max chunk size

Max chunk size parameter controls request payload size. If a file is smaller than max chunk size Jitsu CLI will send
it as one HTTP request. If a file is larger - CLI will divide the file into parts where 1 part size is smaller or equal
max chunk size and send them to Jitsu.

You can override max chunk size configuration with `--chunk_size` flag and value in **bytes**:

- chunk size 100KB = 100 * 1024: `--chunk_size 102400`
- chunk size 10MB = 10 * 1024 * 1024: `--chunk_size 10485760`

```bash
./server replay --api_key s2s.jduavdas.daosbdab --state cli_state.state --chunk_size 10485760 /mydir/*
```

<Hint>
  Make sure that your user have enough permissions for writing state file
</Hint>

### Flags

Please use `./server replay -h` command for displaying all flags and usage

# Privacy Mode

<Hint>
    This feature is available since <b>1.34</b> version.
</Hint>

Jitsu can work in *privacy mode* that makes it compatible with [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/), [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)
(California's version of GDPR), [PECR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/) (UK's GDPR).
In this mode Jitsu:

 * Won't use cookies to identify users; instead of cookies, Jitsu will use fingerprints that are sufficiently enough to identify users.
 * Won't record full IP address of the user. Instead, only first 3 octets will be recorded which is just enough to resolve country, and city


<Hint>
    If privacy mode is off, you should collect a cookie consent for residents of EU, UK and California. Jitsu uses cookie only for
    analytics, so they fall under analytics (or functional) cookies category.
    <br /><br />
    The good idea is to make switch on privacy mode for only those users who didn't consent to cookies,
</Hint>


## Configuration

To switch off privacy mode use `privacy_policy` parameter (or `data-privacy-policy`) following configuration parameter:

```javascript
const { jitsuClient } = require('@jitsu/sdk-js');
const jitsu = jitsuClient({
    key: "[API_KEY]",
    privacy_policy: 'strict'
});
```

or
```html
<script src="%%SERVER%%/s/lib.js"
        data-key="JITSU_API_KEY"
        data-privacy-policy="strict"
        defer></script>
<script>
```

# Privacy Policy

Privacy is very important. At Jitsu we value people's privacy, so we've added supporting of analytics collection without gathering any personal data
or personally identifiable information (PII), without using cookies and respecting your customers privacy.
Jitsu is flexible and can comply with the cookie law and the privacy regulations such
EU General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/)), California Consumer Privacy Act ([CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)),
The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations ([PECR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/)).

## Cookie Banner

Since Jitsu is capable of collecting analytics events without setting cookies, just based on visitors IP addresses and User Agents
you can get rid of annoying cookie banner. Simultaneously, if you've already had "Strictly necessary cookies" on your website or web application,
and a cookie banner must be shown to every customer then you are able to configure switching on/off cookie's usage in Jitsu JS SDK initialization based on visitors decision.

## Cookies usage




##Analytics without 3-rd party cookies
//TODO mb del
When you self-host, your data is all yours. This means your users’ data is not sent to any third-party, not even PostHog. The privacy of your users is preserved, and it is easier to comply with legislation such as GDPR and cookie laws.
PostHog gives you full control over all the data from your users, while allowing you to do powerful analytics.

## Tracking based on IP and User-Agent


## Configuration

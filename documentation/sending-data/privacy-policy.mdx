# Privacy Policy

Privacy is very important. At Jitsu we value people's privacy, so we've added supporting of analytics collection without gathering any personal data
or personally identifiable information (PII), without using cookies and respecting your customers privacy.
Jitsu is flexible and can comply with the cookie law and the privacy regulations such
EU General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/)), California Consumer Privacy Act ([CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)),
The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations ([PECR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/)).

## Cookie Banner

Jitsu JS SDK doesn't require a cookie banner. Since Jitsu is capable of collecting analytics events without setting cookies.
Server processes analytics events and sets anonymous ids just based on visitors IP address and User Agent.
When you use self-hosted instance, your data is all yours (your users data is not sent to any third-party).

## Configuration (in beta)

To initialize **Jitsu** compatible with cookies law, please use:

```javascript
const { jitsuClient } = require('@jitsu/sdk-js');
const jitsu = jitsuClient({
    key: "[API_KEY]",
    privacy_policy: 'strict'
});
```

or
```html
<script src="%%SERVER%%/s/lib.js"
        data-key="JITSU_API_KEY"
        data-privacy-policy="true"
        defer></script>
<script>
```

With this configuration Jitsu doesn't set any cookie at all and doesn't enrich analytics events with visitor IP address
(only with three octets like `10.10.10.10` -> `10.10.10.1`)

# Deploying Jitsu

[**Jitsu**](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu) ‚Äî is an open-source data collection platform. We built
our platform incredibly easy to deploy and use. Below, we have several step-by-step guides outlining
how to set up Jitsu on a variety of different environments  with the easiest being [**Heroku deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-on-heroku) and [**Docker deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker).


## Jitsu Architecture

We built Jitsu to have as few external dependencies as possible. It consists from following services:

 * **Jitsu Server** (üê≥ [@jitsucom/server](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/server)) ‚Äî Jitsu core that does all work such as transformations,
queueing, batching, task scheduling etc.
 * **Jitsu Configurator** (optional) (üê≥ [@jitsucom/configurator](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/configurator)) ‚Äî and optional UI for configuring Jitsu.
Without UI configuration has to be done through [YAML file](https://jitsu.com/docs/configuration). You can try configuration UI at [cloud.jitsu.com](https://cloud.jitsu.com)
 * **Redis** (optional) ‚Äî Redis is required if you have more than one node running Jitsu Server for redundancy (Redis provisions coordination service). Also, Redis is required
if you have [Retrospective User Recognition](/docs/other-features/retrospective-user-recognition) enabled.

Docker Compose file provided with the source code (see [Docker Deployment](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker) for details) runs all 3 services.

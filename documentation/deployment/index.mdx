# Deploying Jitsu

[**Jitsu**](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu) ‚Äî is an open-source data collection platform. We built
our platform incredibly easy to deploy and use. Below, we have several step-by-step guides outlining
how to set up Jitsu on a variety of different environments  with the easiest being [**Heroku deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-on-heroku) and [**Docker deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker).


## Jitsu Architecture

We built **Jitsu** (üê≥ [@jitsucom/jitsu](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/jitsu)) to have as few external dependencies as possible. It consists of following services:

 * **Jitsu Server** (üê≥ [@jitsucom/server](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/server)) ‚Äî Jitsu core that does all work such as transformations,
queueing, batching, task scheduling etc.
 * **Jitsu Configurator** (optional) (üê≥ [@jitsucom/configurator](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/configurator)) ‚Äî and optional UI for configuring Jitsu.
Without UI configuration has to be done through [YAML file](https://jitsu.com/docs/configuration). You can try configuration UI at [cloud.jitsu.com](https://cloud.jitsu.com)

<Hint>
  Jitsu Configurator and some features require <b>Redis</b>: <a href="/docs/other-features/retrospective-user-recognition">Retrospective User Recognition</a>
  or if you have more than one node running Jitsu Server for redundancy (Redis provisions coordination service).
</Hint>

**Jitsu Server** can be used without **Jitsu Configurator** (and UI) with YAML file configuration. Read more about [Jitsu Server docker deployment](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker).

# Deploying Jitsu

[**Jitsu**](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu) ‚Äî is an open-source data collection platform. We built
our platform incredibly easy to deploy and use. Below, we have several step-by-step guides outlining
how to set up Jitsu on a variety of different environments  with the easiest being [**Heroku deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-on-heroku) and [**Docker deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker).


## Jitsu Architecture

We built **Jitsu** (üê≥ [@jitsucom/jitsu](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/jitsu)) to have as few external dependencies as possible. It consists of following services:

 * **Jitsu Server** (üê≥ [@jitsucom/server](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/server)) ‚Äî Jitsu core main application written in GO language.
HTTP service that can accept analytics user events from javascript/API as well as can pull data from 3rd party platforms (such as [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/), [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/), etc) and store it data-warehouse of your choice.
It performs all job such as transformations, queueing, batching, task scheduling etc. Jitsu Server accepts YAML file configuration.
Some sections of YAML configuration can be reloadable. Jitsu Server sends GET requests every N seconds to get reloadable configuration sections such as [api_keys](/docs/configuration/authorization#http-url),
[destinations](/docs/destinations-configuration#configuring-destinations-via-http--endpoint), [sources](docs/sources-configuration#configuring-sources-via-http--endpoint) if they contain HTTP URL.

 * **Jitsu Configurator** (üê≥ [@jitsucom/configurator](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/configurator)) ‚Äî web application that contains
Jitsu User Interface (like on [Jitsu.Cloud](https://cloud.jitsu.com)) and backend - HTTP service written in GO language.
Jitsu Configurator solves the problem of configuring Jitsu Server. You can create your API keys, destinations, sources in user interface
and Jitsu Server will get it via HTTP API. Configurator stores all objects (api keys, destinations, sources) as serialized JSONs in Redis.

<Hint>
  Jitsu Configurator and some features (e.g. <a href="/docs/other-features/retrospective-user-recognition">Retrospective User Recognition</a>) require <b>Redis</b>.
  Also if you have more than one node of Jitsu Server running, Redis is required for redundancy (as provisions coordination service).
</Hint>

**Jitsu** (üê≥ [@jitsucom/jitsu](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/jitsu)) - is a single docker image that includes both services (Jitsu Server and Jitsu Configurator) and [Nginx](https://nginx.org/).
Jitsu has started on `8000` port, there are the following running services inside:
- Jitsu Server starts on `8001` port with **default*** YAML configuration - `api_keys`, `destinations`, `sources` sections are reloadable from Jitsu Configurator.
- Jitsu Configurator starts on `7000` port with **default*** YAML configuration.
- Nginx starts on `8000` and routes all requests from `address:8000/` to Jitsu Server, all requests from `address:8000/configurator` to Jitsu Configurator.

<Hint>
  <b>default*</b> configuration might be overridden with your custom YAML configuration file via docker mount (volumes).
  Simultaneously we do not recommend to override YAML configuration (only if you know what you do). In most cases, it‚Äôs easier to configure Jitsu Server via Configurator UI.
</Hint>

You can try Configurator UI at [Jitsu.Cloud](https://cloud.jitsu.com)
**Jitsu Server** can be used without **Jitsu Configurator** (and UI) with [YAML configuration](https://jitsu.com/docs/configuration). Read more about [Jitsu Server docker deployment](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker).

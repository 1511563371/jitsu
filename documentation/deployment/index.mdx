# Deploying Jitsu

[**Jitsu**](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu) — is an open-source data collection platform. We built
our platform incredibly easy to deploy and use. Below, we have several step-by-step guides outlining
how to set up Jitsu on a variety of different environments  with the easiest being [**Heroku deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-on-heroku) and [**Docker deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker).


## Jitsu Architecture

We built **Jitsu** (🐳 [@jitsucom/jitsu](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/jitsu)) to have as few external dependencies as possible. It consists of following services:

 * **Jitsu Server** (🐳 [@jitsucom/server](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/server)) — Jitsu core that does all work such as transformations,
queueing, batching, task scheduling etc.
 * **Jitsu Configurator** (🐳 [@jitsucom/configurator](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/configurator)) — contains UI and backend for configuring Jitsu.
You can try Configurator UI at [cloud.jitsu.com](https://cloud.jitsu.com)

**Jitsu Server** can be used without **Jitsu Configurator** (and UI) with [YAML configuration](https://jitsu.com/docs/configuration). Read more about [Jitsu Server docker deployment](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker).

<Hint>
  Jitsu Configurator and some features (e.g. <a href="/docs/other-features/retrospective-user-recognition">Retrospective User Recognition</a>) require <b>Redis</b>.
  Also if you have more than one node of Jitsu Server running, Redis is required for redundancy (as provisions coordination service).

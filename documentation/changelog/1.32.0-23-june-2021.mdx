### Users Onboarding Framework
We love❤️ our users! We've improved Jitsu setup experience.
Now you can configure the first destination just in seconds - beautiful dialogs will help you!

Now you don't need to configure catalog in Singer sources! Jitsu discovers catalog structure and selects all stream fields
automatically on Singer source initialization! Just write Singer config credentials and let it work!

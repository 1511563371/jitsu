# 1.34 - 27 July 2021

Jitsu `1.34` is out! Here are the biggest changes:

### Connections UI

Is it hard for you to keep track of your project's connections? We are here to help! On the new UI Connections page you will find a visual representation of relations between your API keys, Sources, and Destinations. It will help to spot missing connections and orphan or inactive entities. Just click on an entity of your interest and fix its settings right away.

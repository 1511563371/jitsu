# This package is deprecated!

### Background

kSense got a new name, now we're called [Jitsu](https://jitsu.com). So does the package, 
it's called [@jitsu/eventnative](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jitsu/eventnative) now


### Backward compatibility

Starting from 1.0.13 @ksense/eventnative just forwards all calls to [@jitsu/eventnative](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jitsu/eventnative).
However, it's highly recommended updating your dependency to the latest version [@jitsu/eventnative](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jitsu/eventnative)
